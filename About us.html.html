    <h1><i> ABOUT US </i></h1>
    <p>
        One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.
        <br>
        To build Open Library, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki interface, and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site.
        <br>
        To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions, with more on the way.
        <br>

Booklogy is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the documentation is open, and we welcome your contribution. Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a widget--it's all welcome. We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot, but we can't do it alone!
